# Privacy Policy

Sightic Analytics is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information that we receive from users of our iOS app, including our machine learning algorithms and other artificial intelligence technologies.

## Information we collect and use

The app is used for estimating the cognitive impairment of the user. This is achieved by instructing the user to follow a dot that moves around on the screen while standing still. The app collects blendshapes, gaze estimation and head position of the app user's face provided by ARKit during the test that follows. The app estimates how well the app user was able to perform on the test based on this and other information. Video or still imagery of the user's face is not saved, nor does this information leave the device. The app does not use audio data.

## Sharing Your Information

No person information is stored nor shared with third parties. No personal information leaves the device.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information that we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. No personal information leaves the devices, nor is the personal information stored on the device.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice on our website and mobile app, and obtain your consent if required by law.
