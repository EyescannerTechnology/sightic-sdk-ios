# Privacy Policy

Sightic Analytics is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information that we receive from users of our iOS app, including our machine learning algorithms and other artificial intelligence technologies.

## 1. Information we collect and use

The app uses the front camera of the phone to capture the movement of the user's head. It also captures the facial expression (e.g., whether eyelids and mouth are opened), device motion, and the device model identifier. This identifier is used to determine if the phone model is supported by our service. The collected data is a mathematical representation of the face and cannot be used to identify an individual.

The data is processed by a machine learning model on our server to classify the user as being impaired or not. All network traffic is encrypted.

The data is only retained by us for the duration of the test and is immediately discarded afterwards.

The user needs to consent before we collect any data, and if the consent is revoked the app will no longer collect any data.

No video or still imagery of the user's face is saved, nor does this information leave the device. The app does not use audio data.

## 2. Sharing Your Information

No personal information is stored nor shared with third parties. No personal information leaves the device.

## 3. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information that we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. No personal information leaves the devices, nor is the personal information stored on the device.

## 4. Changes to this Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice on our website and mobile app and obtain your consent if required by law.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at [dpo@sightic.com](mailto:dpo@sightic.com).
