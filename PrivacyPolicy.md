# Privacy Policy

Sightic Analytics is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose personal information that we receive from users of our iOS app, including our machine learning algorithms and other artificial intelligence technologies.

## Information we collect and use

While performing the test, the app uses the front camera of the phone to continuously capture the movement of the user's head. It also captures some of the user's facial features. The collected data is only a mathematical representation of face, and can not be used to identify an individual.

No video or still imagery of the user's face is saved, nor does this information leave the device. The app does not use audio data.

## Sharing Your Information

No person information is stored nor shared with third parties. No personal information leaves the device.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the personal information that we collect from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. No personal information leaves the devices, nor is the personal information stored on the device.

## Changes to this Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice on our website and mobile app, and obtain your consent if required by law.
